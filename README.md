## 🔥 Firebase Configuration Setup

### **1. Create Your Firebase Project**
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Create a new project
3. Enable Authentication, Firestore Database, and Analytics

### **2. Get Your Configuration**
// From Firebase Console > Project Settings > General > Your apps
const firebaseConfig = {
apiKey: "your-api-key",
authDomain: "your-project.firebaseapp.com",
projectId: "your-project-id",
// ... other config values
};

text

### **3. Update the Firebase Configuration**

**Option 1: Environment Variables (Recommended)**
Create `.env` file in your project root:
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL=https://your-project-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com

};

text

### **4. Configure Firestore Rules**
In Firebase Console > Firestore Database > Rules:
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
match /databases/{database}/documents {
// Allow authenticated users to read/write their own data
match /users/{userId} {
allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
}

text
// Allow authenticated users to read/write analytics
match /userAnalytics/{userId} {
  allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
}

// Allow authenticated users to write login logs
